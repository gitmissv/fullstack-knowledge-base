# Planning & Building Projects

1.  PLANNING:

    a. General Idea

        i. Who is audience? Who would use this?

        ii. What ‘type’ of person are you creating this for? Talk with some of them and get their input (survey formal or informal)

    b. What is your personal goal?

        i. Just to put on your portfolio?

        ii. Learning opportunity?

        iii. To make $$?

    c. Give yourself deadlines!

        i. Don’t procrastinate – create a plan.

        ii. Give yourself a reason to be accountable.

        iii. Get someone to hold you accountable.

    d. FOCUS on your MVP features!

        i. Start SIMPLE! K.I.S.S. <Keep It Simple, Stupid>

        ii. What do you HAVE TO HAVE vs what you would like.

        iii. Get CORE functionality down FIRST

        iv. What do you need immediately, then what you would like to have ‘later”.

2.  EXECUTION

    a. FOCUS on ONE THING AT A TIME

         i. Break down items until each is completed.

         ii. Use Trello to track IDEAS, What you’re working on, and what’s next.

         iii. Also use github to track as GitHub “issues”.

    b. Ask for Help!!

         i. Talk with other coders whenever you get stuck.

         ii.

    c. Follow Tutorials!

         i. Tutorials help LEARN code – esp something new.

         ii. Take what you learned (concepts, etc) and make them a little different so that you reinforce what you’ve learned.

    d. Sketch it out

         i. Design on a notepad FIRST – to get a feel for navigation and movement of your application.

         ii. Figma, or Sketch, design tools after you have it on paper.

         iii. Ask for help from a DESIGNER.

    e. Ship the MVP

         i. Send your app to others to try it out and ask for feedback!

# JIRA – FREE Agile Project Management

Jira Software is _FREE_ for up to 10 uses

_Trello = another software proj mgmt. tool for Beginners_ Trello is more ‘user-friendly’ version of project management.

### AGILE PROCESS STAGES

- Functionality
- Planning
- Implementation
- Testing
- Review

Create \*_Element_ for your project – in Jira that’s called an “Issue” = Task, Bug, Story

- Epic = an abstract view of what you’re creating for your client
- Sprint = your project workflow
- Story = a feature within your project

### Scrum Roles:

Hierarchy of employees working on a software development project and how they function to achieve the agile development.

- _Project Owner_: Responsible for the entire project

- _Scrum Master_: Middle man that connects and manages the flow of information between the Project Owner and the development team

- _Scrum Team_: Employees that are ‘hands-on’ and working on tasks.

#

### PROJECT MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS

- **Agile**: _Agile_ is a software development methodology meant to increase teams’ efficiency by self-organizing the work to promote rapid and flexible response to change.

- **Sprint**: _Sprint_ is a pre-determined amount of time (usually two weeks) whereby a team decides on and works to finish a specified amount of work.

- **Kanban**: _Kanban_ is a scheduling system or workflow management method developed by an engineer at Toyota that helps visualize the work and promote continuous improvement. A Kanban Board in software development usually consists of these three primary columns laid out side by side:

  - First Col: Todo
  - Second Col: In Progress
  - Third Col: Completed

- **Jira**: _Jira_ is an advanced project management and issue tracking tool.

- **User Story**: A _User Story_ is an example narrative of an imaginary user of a product. A typical user story sounds like this: “As a (product name) user, I want (some goal) so that (some reason).”

- **Epic**: An _Epic_ is a feature or project goal that is too big for a single sprint. They are usually broken down into multiple user stories that, when finished, complete the Epic.
