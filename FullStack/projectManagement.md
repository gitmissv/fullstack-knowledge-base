# Planning & Building Projects

1. PLANNING:

   a. General Idea
   i. Who is audience? Who would use this?
   ii. What ‘type’ of person are you creating this for? Talk with some of them and get their input (survey formal or informal)

   b. What is your personal goal?
   i. Just to put on your portfolio?
   ii. Learning opportunity?
   iii. To make $$?

   c. Give yourself deadlines!
   i. Don’t procrastinate – create a plan.
   ii. Give yourself a reason to be accountable.
   iii. Get someone to hold you accountable.

   d. FOCUS on your MVP features!
   i. Start SIMPLE! K.I.S.S. <Keep It Simple, Stupid>
   ii. What do you HAVE TO HAVE vs what you would like.
   iii. Get CORE functionality down FIRST
   iv. What do you need immediately, then what you would like to have ‘later”.

2. EXECUTION

   a. FOCUS on ONE THING AT A TIME
   i. Break down items until each is completed.
   ii. Use Trello to track IDEAS, What you’re working on, and what’s next.
   iii. Also use github to track as GitHub “issues”.

   b. Ask for Help!!
   i. Talk with other coders whenever you get stuck.
   ii.

   c. Follow Tutorials!
   i. Tutorials help LEARN code – esp something new.
   ii. Take what you learned (concepts, etc) and make them a little different so that you reinforce what you’ve learned.

   d. Sketch it out
   i. Design on a notepad FIRST – to get a feel for navigation and movement of your application.
   ii. Figma, or Sketch, design tools after you have it on paper.
   iii. Ask for help from a DESIGNER.

   e. Ship the MVP
   i. Send your app to others to try it out and ask for feedback!
